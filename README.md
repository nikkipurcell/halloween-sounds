# Halloween Soundboard
A fun Halloween soundboard to use when you want some spooky sound effects!

## Usage
First visit the page here: https://nikkipurcell.github.io/halloween-sounds/ Then click any of the keyboard keys for the letter that matches the sound you'd like to hear. You can click them as many times as you like.

## Technology
I built this using good ol' vanilla JavaScript. Using eventListeners for the keydown and also the transition events. Oh and some nice css to measure.
